    "## Lambda Function\n",
    "\n",
    "A _lambda function_ is a way of defining a function in a single line of code. Usually, we would assign them to a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following lambda function multiplies a number by 2 and then adds 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mylambda = lambda x: (x * 2) + 3\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "13\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break this syntax down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function is stored in a variable called `mylambda`\n",
    "2. `lambda` declares that this is a lambda function (if you are familiar with normal Python functions, this is similar to how we use def to declare a function)\n",
    "3. `x` is what we call the input we are passing into `mylambda`\n",
    "4. We are returning `(x * 2) + 3` (with normal Python functions, we use the keyword return)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions only work if we’re just doing a one line command. If we wanted to write something longer, we’d need a more complex function. Lambda functions are great when you need to use a function once. Because you aren’t defining a function, the reusability aspect functions is not present with lambda functions. By saving the work of defining a function, a lambda function allows us to efficiently run an expression and produce an output for a specific task, such as defining a column in a table, or populating information in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lambda functions work with all types of variables, not just integers! Here is an example that takes in a string, assigns it to the temporary variable x, and then converts it into lowercase:\n",
    "\n",

    "The output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"oh hi mark!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make our lambdas more complex by using a modified form of an if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to pay workers time-and-a-half for overtime (any work above 40 hours per week). The following function will convert the number of hours into time-and-a-half hours using an if statement:\n",

    "def myfunction(x):\n",
    "    if x > 40:\n",
